# Project Acessibility Report 

## Preamable

This report outlined the principles of Universal Design we followed, the target audience, and its demograpic respect to the project.

## Principles of Universal Design Used
### 1. Pareto Principle

Pareto Principle states that:
> - 80% of consequences come from 20% of the cause
> - The notion that not all things are equal and the minority owns the majority.
> 
> -- Quoted from Investopedia.

For a 2D platformer game, it is not necessary to have too much extra functionality that won't be used in the game since the main idea is the gameplay. In a UX context, 80% of the user would use 20% of the main feature so we made sure to enhanced and detailed our basic functionality.

### 2. Fitts' Law

Fitts' Law states that:
> - the amount of time required for a person to move a pointer (e.g., mouse cursor) to a target area is a function of the distance to the target divided by the size of the target.
> -  the longer the distance and the smaller the target’s size, the longer it takes.
>
> -- Quoted from Interaction Design Foundation
> https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/fitts-law

For our project, we intentionally made the button size larger for users to require less reaction time to interact with the scene.This way the users can be more accessible and understand each user interface component at a faster pace.

### 3. Norman's Affordance

Norman's Affordance states that:
> -  Only actions which users consider possible. 
> - Designers must create objects' affordances to conform to users' needs based on these users' physical and perceptual capabilities, goals and past experiences.
>
> -- Quoted from Interaction Design Foundation
> https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-glossary-of-human-computer-interaction/affordances

For the majority of the buttons implemented in the user interfaces, we labeled them by their functionality to which shows Perceptible Affordance, *Object itself indicate what action possibilities are available and desired.*

In addition, when pausing the game or exiting from a certain scene of the game, the users are supposed to press **Esc** to exit or pause the current scene. This uses the Hidden Affordance, *users often must rely on experience and/or trial and error to determine possible actions.*

### 4. Perceptible Information

Perceptible Information states that:
> - The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user’s sensory abilities. 
> 
> -- Quoted from University of Buffalo
> https://www.buffalo.edu/access/help-and-support/topic3/universaldesignprinciples.html

For users who have a hard time reading multiple words, our text-to-speech function which read the jokes to the user kept them from reading any words and use auditory receptors.

## Target Audience
Our main target audience are the people who likes to play games generally. However, with some of the levels being tricky and micro intensive, our game may attract hardcore player who crave for challenges.

## Demographic
Our project attempt including all inclusivity. However, with certain game mechanic which may requires specific controls by the user. This causes user with Ataxia or other conditions that affect hand coordination have much harder time to enjoy and complete the game.
